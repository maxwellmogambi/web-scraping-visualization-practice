# web-scraping-visualization-practice
Purpose:
The purpose of this project was primarily focused on web scraping data from multiple pages, specifically from the website books.toscrape.com. Additionally, this project aimed to practice various visualization techniques using the collected data.

Project Overview:
Web scraped data from books.toscrape.com, collecting information on book titles, prices, and ratings across multiple pages.
Performed data cleaning and analysis on the collected dataset.
Utilized Python libraries such as BeautifulSoup for web scraping and Pandas for data manipulation.
Explored various visualization techniques including histograms, bar charts, scatter plots, word clouds, and heatmaps to gain insights into the dataset.
Calculated and visualized average prices per rating category and explored price distributions across genres.
Files Included:
books_webscraping.csv: CSV file containing the collected book data (titles, prices, and ratings).
bookscrapping.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook with code for web scraping and various visualization techniques.
README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project and its objectives.
Purpose of Visualization Techniques:
Histograms: Visualized distributions of prices and ratings.
Bar Charts: Compared average prices across rating categories and genres.
Scatter Plots: Explored relationships between book prices and ratings.
Word Clouds: Displayed frequently occurring book titles to identify popular themes.
Heatmaps: Visualized rating distributions across genres for insights.
Project Conclusion:
This project allowed for hands-on practice in web scraping techniques and exploring different visualization methods to gain insights from collected data.
